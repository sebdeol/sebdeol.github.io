  <section><h2 id="methodology-and-research-methods">Methodology and Research Methods</h2>
<p>I started this third week a bit stressed. For the next 3/4 weeks, the doubling-up of modules is coming right back at me. I have two assignments to give back for my other module and lots of reading and formative activities for this module.</p>
<p>In this unit, I have learned the difference between Exploratory Research and Conclusive Research. As mentioned previously, new concepts to me. If I had to resume briefly, exploratory research investigates a problem that is not yet clearly defined. On the other hand, conclusive research verifies insights to determine a course of action.</p>
<p>There are lots of terms to learn and become familiar with. Qualitative; Quantitative; Mixed Research methods; Primary vs Secondary data collection. I am still not 100% sure how I will leverage all these different frameworks for my very own research. While controversial given the amount of work required by this module, I would have benefited from more concrete examples illustrating when to use each methodology.</p>
<p>After this week, I feel a bit better for my research, though I will need to think critically about which methods best fit my specific questions and context.</p>
<h3 id="e-portfolio-assessment-and-formative-activities">e-Portfolio Assessment and Formative Activities</h3>
<h4 id="collaborative-discussion">Collaborative Discussion</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, this week I had to sacrifice the collaborative discussion once again. I don&rsquo;t like not to participate in those but between two modules and work, I had to make some priority choices. Hopefully, I can start the discussion in the next unit.</p>
<h4 id="research-proposal-review">Research Proposal Review</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Which of the methods described in this week&rsquo;s reading would you think would suit your purpose?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I think a mixed methods approach combining qualitative analysis of misinformation examples with quantitative machine learning techniques would likely suit my proposal better.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which data collection methods would you consider using?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I would consider using secondary data collection, gathering an existing dataset of verified true and false information from the X platform to train and test ML models.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Which required skills will you need to have or develop for the chosen project?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I will need to develop skills in natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. I am by no means an expert so it will definitely be a challenge. But it excites me.</p>
