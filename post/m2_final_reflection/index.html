<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>What a module! I won&rsquo;t lie, it&rsquo;s been a long twelve weeks. In between work and the sheer amount of work expected in this module, I didn&rsquo;t have much time to relax.
In the first few weeks, I found myself learning more about Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), UML diagrams and the subtle art of writing sustainable and maintainable code. I had no idea what UML was and I struggled to understand its core concepts at the beginning. As the weeks and units passed, everything started to make more sense. Below is a rundown of everything I have learned in the past twelve weeks.</p>
<h2 id="learnings-and-assignments">Learnings and Assignments</h2>
<p>The module started with an introduction of Python&rsquo;s syntax and Object-Oriented semantics. After a few weeks, the curriculum introduced more advanced concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. I&rsquo;ll admit, all foreign concepts to me at the time. But I didn&rsquo;t despair, what struck me the most was Python&rsquo;s simplicity. I found Python&rsquo;s syntax to be liberating, as it, in my opinion, encourages simple coding. As I progressed through the module, we were introduced to UML (Unified Modeling Language), a visual modeling language that helps software developers visualise and construct new systems (<a href="https://www.gliffy.com">www.gliffy.com</a>, n.d.). I had never crossed paths with UML diagrams before, so I had to do a ton of research around it. It then became clear to me that UML diagrams are an important part of software and system designs.</p>
<p>While I was learning about polymorphism in the fifth unit, work told me that I had to go to the US office for three weeks. After I checked against my calendar, I realised it would fall in the last three weeks of this module. Probably the busiest weeks as two assignments were due. It did take its toll on me, as the time difference, work and studying at the same time would make things harder than they currently are.
Anyway, in week seven, I submitted my first assignment to the platform. We had to basically apply all the learnings we had made on the UML diagrams. The summative assessment was for a system design of a driverless car. We had to write about our design rationale in 500 words and come up with five different diagrams all in order to support the design. When we got the results, I was pretty disappointed in myself as I got a 64% grade. Not bad by any means, but I&rsquo;ve put the bar high. I&rsquo;m aiming for as many distinctions (70% or more) as possible in all the modules&rsquo; assignments. After receiving my tutor&rsquo;s feedback, they highlighted that my use case diagram wasn&rsquo;t correct, so I went back to the materials to make sure I understood everything correctly and that I wouldn&rsquo;t make this error again.</p>
<p>In between week seven and eleven, we dived further into Python and how to apply different designs and patterns to our code. It was really enriching, but honestly, sometimes, it was quite hard to understand the meaning of all these concepts. Things such as polymorphism, inheritance etc. I had to do a lot more reading and research extensively to start to understand what it was all about. In week eleven, I submitted another assignment. This time, it was the code that matched against the system design from week seven. We had to design a driverless car system with three fundamental systems. I choose <code>AutonomousNavigation</code>, <code>EnvironmentalPerception</code> and <code>UserInteraction</code>. We also had to come up with a testing strategy, I choose to write all the unit tests with pytest. However, I was doubting whether I understood the assignment requirements correctly or not. Anyway, I clicked the upload button and got my tutor&rsquo;s feedback after a couple of days: 75% grade! I was pleased about that. I had struggled to understand object-oriented design in the first few weeks, so that was a real testament to my hard work.</p>
<p>In week ten, I replied to a fellow student on the group discussion. I was a bit late due to work constraints, but I made the time to reply. I highlighted some potential flaws in their discussion and introduced them to the IoT security and vulnerability side of things. I also read the material and came up with an Initial Post. A fellow student responded with suggested readings, which I greatly appreciated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To sum it all up, the module was a great learning experience, though I had my ups and downs. I got to explore object-oriented programming concepts and principles, got my hands dirty with UML diagrams, and got introduced to automated testing with Pytest. Sure, I had some trouble with assignment requirements and time management, especially with me being in the US for three weeks but I also got to walk away with some great assignments’ grades and feedback. Sadly, I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy the group discussion as only another student and I participated. I am not sure how many students were part of this module, but surely it wasn&rsquo;t just the two of us. I&rsquo;m keen to connect with more students in the coming modules and I hope they are too. Here&rsquo;s to the two weeks off and the next module!</p>
